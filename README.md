Group 5: South German Credit
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using data visualization, for example, histogram of the features, boxplot, and apart from this you are encouraged to explore EDA and plot relevant graphs.
1a. Identify the outliers in the dataset 
1b. Plot the correlation matrix for the dataset. 
1c. Plot the graphical distribution for the variables 
2. Identify the optimal number of clusters in the dataset. You may want to compare silhouette and elbow method. 
3. Use k-means algorithm for creating the clusters.
3a. Credit amount vs age 
3b. Credit amount vs duration 
3c. Age vs duration 
4. Interpret each of the clusters in question 3.
5. Use HDBSCAN to perform hierarchical clustering and plot the dendrogram.
6. Explore various performance metrics of clustering algorithm and compare them.
